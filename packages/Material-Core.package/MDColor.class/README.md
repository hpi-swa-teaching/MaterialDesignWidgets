All your color are belong to us.

I store all color shades for a specific hue as specified in the Material Design guidelines: https://material.io/design/color/the-color-system.html. Shade 50 is my lightest and 900 is my dark side.

When (ab)using me as a simple color, I behave like my 500-shade.

On my class side, you can find all color palettes specified in the 2014 guidelines.
